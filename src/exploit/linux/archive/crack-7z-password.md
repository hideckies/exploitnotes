## Crack

### 1. Convert to Hash

First we need to convert the `.7z` file to hash.

```sh
7z2john example.7z > hash.txt
# or
/usr/share/john/7z2john.pl example.7z > hash.txt
```

If we got the error “`Can't locate Compress/Raw/Lzma.pm in @INC`...”, we need to install `libcompress-raw-lzma-perl` package so try:

```bash
sudo apt install libcompress-raw-lzma-perl
```

### 2. Crack the Hash

Now we can crack the hash with one of the commands below:

```sh
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
# or
hashcat -m 11600 hash.txt wordlist.txt
```
