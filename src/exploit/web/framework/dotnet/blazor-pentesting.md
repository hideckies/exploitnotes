## Common Directories/Files

```bash
# This file contains paths of DLLs that can be reversed.
/_framework/blazor.boot.json
/_framework/<Example>.dll
```

<br />

## Reverse Engineering DLLs

We can reverse DLLs such as `/_framework/<Example>.dll` using tools such as **DotPeek** for retrieving sensitive information (credentials, software versions, etc.).

If you use DotPeek, right-click on the name in Assembly Explorer and click **Decompiled Sources** for investigation.
